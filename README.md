This project explores how tumor evolution differs between young and aged mice through sequential transplantation and scRNA-seq analysis. By studying tumor progression, cell-cell interactions (via LIANA & CellphoneDB), spatial distribution (using Squidpy & MERFISH), and bulk RNA-seq data (DESeq2), I identify selection-driven differences in tumor growth and cellular composition. Five generations of tumor reimplantation reveal distinct age-related evolutionary pressures, offering insights into cancer progression and treatment responses.
